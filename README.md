# Golang MySQL Database Monitoring Codebase

This repository contains an advanced and thoroughly engineered Golang codebase developed for MySQL database monitoring purposes. It also covers numerous other technologies including Redis, Prometheus, Grafana, Docker, and extensively uses GitHub as a primary source control system.

## Programming Language

- **Go**: The primary language that the codebase is built upon.

## Databases

- **MySQL**: A widely-used, open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). The primary database this codebase monitors.
- **Redis**: An open-source, in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker.

## Monitoring

Here are the primary monitoring tools that this codebase exploits for MySQL database monitoring.

- **Prometheus**: An open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit.
- **Grafana**: A multi-platform open-source analytics and interactive visualization web application.

## Tools

Several tools are being used to develop and maintain this codebase efficiently.

- **GitHub**: The go-to collaborative platform for sharing and versioning the codebase.
- **Docker**: A platform to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications through containerization.
